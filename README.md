PowerSwitch-Arduino-Sketches
============================

I have been working on a project to build an automated ventilation system into my workshop and have been testing out a [PowerSwitch Tail II](http://www.powerswitchtail.com/Pages/default.aspx) to control power switching (hah!) to my fan unit. This is the reason why you will see lots of reference to the word 'fan' in my examples. Do note however, this should apply to any device that can be switched on/off - in fact, i did most of my testing with a desk lamp.

Enjoy the examples!
