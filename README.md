Arduino Sketches
============================

These are a collection of some of the Arduino sketches I have been working on. Most revolve around controlloing power, which I have chosen to use a [PowerSwitch Tail II](http://www.powerswitchtail.com/Pages/default.aspx) for. Several of these sketches have been been written for my work on a project to build an automated ventilation system into my workshop, which is the reason why you will see lots of reference to the word 'fan' in my examples. Do note however, this should apply to any device that can be switched on/off - in fact, i did most of my testing with a desk lamp.

Enjoy!
